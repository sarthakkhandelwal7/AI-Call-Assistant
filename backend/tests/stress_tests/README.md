# AI Call Assistant Stress Testing Framework

This directory contains a comprehensive stress testing framework for the AI Call Assistant backend. These tests are designed to evaluate the system's performance, resilience, and stability under various load conditions.

## Overview

The stress testing framework provides several specialized test types designed to evaluate different aspects of the system:

1. **HTTP Basic Test** - Verifies basic HTTP connectivity
2. **Throughput Test** - Measures audio streaming throughput
3. **Resilience Test** - Tests the system's ability to handle errors
4. **Load Test** - Evaluates performance with gradually increasing load
5. **High Concurrency Test** - Tests the system with many simultaneous calls
6. **Wave Pattern Test** - Simulates realistic call volume patterns
7. **Burst Pattern Test** - Evaluates handling of sudden traffic spikes
8. **Stability Test** - Tests system stability over extended periods
9. **Resource Monitoring Test** - Identifies specific system bottlenecks

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the `run_tests.py` script, which provides a convenient wrapper around the underlying `run_server_tests.py` implementation.

Basic usage:

```bash
python tests/stress_tests/run_tests.py --test-type [test_type] [options]
```

### Common Options

-   `--test-type` - Type of test to run (default: "throughput" on Linux/macOS, "http_basic" on Windows)

-   `--output, -o` - File to save test results in JSON format

## Best Practices for Testing

1. **Start with Basic Tests**: Begin with the HTTP basic test to ensure basic connectivity.
2. **Throughput Testing**: Use throughput tests to establish baseline performance.
3. **Load Testing**: Run load tests to determine maximum capacity.
4. **Error Handling**: Use resilience tests to verify error handling mechanisms.
5. **Real-world Patterns**: Use wave and burst pattern tests to simulate realistic scenarios.
6. **Extended Testing**: Run stability tests for at least 30 minutes before production deployment.
7. **Bottleneck Identification**: Use resource monitoring tests when performance drops to identify the specific limiting factor.

## Database Connection Pool Settings

The AI Call Assistant uses a configurable database connection pool to optimize performance under varying loads. These settings are defined in environment files and can be adjusted based on the environment:

### Settings in Environment Files

Each environment (development, test, production) has its own optimized connection pool settings:

```
# Database Connection Pool Settings
DB_POOL_SIZE=<number>         # Number of connections kept in the pool
DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=<number>      # Maximum extra connections allowed when pool is exhausted
DB_POOL_TIMEOUT=<seconds>     # How long to wait for a connection when pool is exhausted
DB_POOL_RECYCLE=<seconds>     # Recycle connections after this many seconds
```

### Recommended Values

| Environment | Pool Size | Max Overflow | Pool Timeout | Pool Recycle |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Development | 10        | 10           | 30           | 1800         |
| Testing     | 40        | 20           | 30           | 1800         |
| Production  | 50        | 25           | 30           | 1800         |

### Adjusting for Performance

If the load tests show degraded performance with concurrent calls:

1. Check the resource monitoring test results to identify bottlenecks
2. If database connections are the bottleneck, increase `DB_POOL_SIZE` and `DB_MAX_OVERFLOW`
3. Re-run load tests to verify improvements
4. Monitor in production to fine-tune these values

## Interpreting Test Results

-   **Success Rate < 70%**: System is overloaded and cannot handle the current load.
-   **Success Rate 70-80%**: System is reaching capacity; consider scaling.
-   **Success Rate > 80%**: System is handling the load adequately.
-   **Success Rate 100%**: System has excess capacity.
