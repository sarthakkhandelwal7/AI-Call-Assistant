# AWS Deployment Docker Compose Configuration
# Assumes images have been built using multi-stage Dockerfiles
# Environment variables (especially secrets) should be injected by the deployment environment (e.g., AWS ECS Task Definition)

        environment:
            # Example: Override APP_ENV if not set in .env.dev or via injection
            - APP_ENV=dev
            # Injected variables from AWS/Terraform will override env_file values
        # Ports are exposed by Dockerfile (8000), mapping handled by Load Balancer
        restart: always
        # No depends_on for external database
# AWS Deployment typically doesn't define networks/volumes managed by compose
# These are usually handled by the cloud infrastructure (VPC, EFS, RDS, etc.)
